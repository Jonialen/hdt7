I enjoy eating a fresh apple every morning.
The book I'm reading is very interesting.
My car needs a check-up at the garage.
The trees in the park are starting to bloom.
I use the computer for both work and leisure.
I gave my mother a bouquet of flowers for her birthday.
I always carry a pencil in my case for taking notes.
The clock on the wall shows the wrong time.
I bought a new pair of shoes for the party.
I had a strange dream last night; I was flying over the mountains.
